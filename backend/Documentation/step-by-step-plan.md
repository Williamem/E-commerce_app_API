### Project Setup
- Set up a new project using Node.js and Express for the backend.
- Initialize a new database using Postgres to store product, user, and order data.
- Install necessary dependencies such as Swagger for API documentation and Mocha/Chai for testing.
### Database Design
- Design the database schema in 3rd normal form to efficiently store and retrieve data.
- Create tables for managing users, products, stock, and orders.
- Establish relationships between the different entities within the database.
### Frontend Development
- Build user interfaces for account creation, login, product browsing, and basket management using React.
- Implement mock purchase process for demonstration purposes.
- Create an admin interface to manage products, stock, and orders.
### API Documentation and Endpoint Definition
- Define API endpoints for user account creation, login, product browsing, basket management, and admin functionalities.
- Create API documentation using Swagger to provide clear and detailed information about the endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.
### Backend Development and Testing
- Develop user authentication and authorization using OAuth or Passport to secure the API endpoints.
- Build and test the defined API endpoints, following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach using Mocha and Chai.
### Security Implementation
- Integrate user authentication using OAuth or Passport to ensure secure access to the API.
- Apply data encryption techniques to protect sensitive user data and passwords.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
- Set up role-based access control for regular users and administrators, controlling their permissions and access to specific API endpoints.
- Ensure secure communication between the frontend and the API by implementing HTTPS encryption.
### Deployment
- Deploy the backend API to a server, ensuring proper configuration and security measures.
- Deploy the frontend application to a hosting service for demonstration purposes.

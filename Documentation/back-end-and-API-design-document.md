# Server/API Design Document

## Introduction:
This document outlines the design and architecture of the backend server/API for our E-commerce application. The server/API will handle client requests, process data, interact with the database, and provide responses back to the client.

### Goals:
- Develop a scalable and robust backend using Node.js and Express.js.
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Design well-documented API endpoints for managing users, products, inventory, and orders.
- Ensure efficient data processing and minimal response times.

### Architecture Overview:
- The backend will be developed using Node.js runtime environment with Express.js framework for building RESTful APIs.
- Postgres will be used as the relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and manage application data.
- Swagger will be utilized for API documentation to provide clear and detailed information about endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods.

### Components:
- Routing Layer: Define routes for handling incoming requests and routing them to appropriate controller functions.
- Controller Layer: Contains business logic to process requests, interact with the database, and generate responses.
- Data Access Layer: Interacts with the Postgres database using Sequelize ORM or native SQL queries.
- Authentication Middleware: Validates user credentials and generates access tokens for authorized requests.
- Error Handling Middleware: Centralized error handling to provide consistent error responses.
- Request Validation Middleware: Validates incoming request payloads to ensure data integrity and security.

### Endpoints:
- User Management Endpoints: /api/users/register, /api/users/login, /api/users/logout
- Product Management Endpoints: /api/products, /api/products/:id, etc.
- Inventory Management Endpoints: /api/inventory, /api/inventory/:id, etc.
- Order Management Endpoints: /api/orders, /api/orders/:id, etc.

### Security Measures:
- User Authentication: Implement secure authentication methods such as OAuth or token-based authentication to ensure users accessing the API are properly authenticated and authorized.
- Data Encryption: Protect sensitive user data and passwords using encryption techniques to prevent unauthorized access.
- Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user inputs on the server-side to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
- Role-based Access Control: Implement different access levels for regular users and administrators to control their permissions and access to specific API endpoints.
- Secure Communication: Ensure that communications between the frontend and the API are encrypted using HTTPS to prevent data interception.

### Testing and Quality Assurance:
- Write unit tests for controller functions, middleware, and database interactions using testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai.
- Perform integration tests to validate the interaction between different layers of the application.
- (Conduct security audits and vulnerability assessments regularly.)

### Documentation:
- Provide comprehensive documentation for API endpoints, including request/response schemas and usage examples.
- Document server setup instructions, configuration options, and deployment procedures for future reference.

### (Deployment and Scalability:)
- (Deploy the backend API to a cloud-based server (e.g., AWS, Azure) ensuring proper configuration and security measures.)
- (Utilize containerization technologies like Docker for packaging and deploying the application.)
- (Implement horizontal scaling strategies to handle increased traffic and load balancing.)

### (Monitoring and Logging:)
- (Implement logging mechanisms to record application events and errors for troubleshooting.)
- (Utilize monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time performance monitoring.)
- (Set up alerts for critical events such as server downtime or high error rates.)

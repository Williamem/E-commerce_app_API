# Frontend Design Document

## Introduction:
The frontend design document outlines the architecture, components, and functionalities of the user interface for our E-commerce application. The frontend will focus on providing an intuitive and engaging interface for users to interact with, showcasing key features such as account creation, product browsing, basket management, and a simulated purchase process.

### Goals:
- Develop a responsive and visually appealing user interface using React.js.
- Implement user authentication and authorization features for account creation and login functionality.
- Design intuitive user interfaces for product browsing, search, and basket management.
- Create a seamless checkout experience for initiating a mock purchase.
- Develop an admin interface for managing products, inventory, and orders.

### Architecture Overview:
- The frontend will be built using React.js library for building reusable UI components and managing state efficiently.
- Redux will be utilized for state management, especially for global states such as user authentication and basket management.
- The application will follow a component-based architecture for modularity and maintainability.

### Components:
- User Authentication: Components for account creation, login form, and authentication workflows.
- Product Catalog: UI components to display products, filter by categories, and search functionality.
- Basket Management: Components to view and manage items in the shopping basket, including adding and removing products.
- Checkout Process: Interface for initiating a mock purchase, displaying order summary, and collecting payment details (for demonstration purposes).
- Admin Dashboard: Components for administrators to manage products, inventory, and orders.

### Functionality:
- User Authentication: Implement account creation, login, and logout functionality with proper error handling and validation.
- Product Browsing: Display products with relevant details, enabling users to filter by categories and search for specific items.
- Basket Management: Allow users to add and remove items from their shopping basket, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- Checkout Process: Simulate a checkout process with a mock payment flow, displaying order summary and confirmation messages.
- Admin Interface: Provide administrators with access to manage products, update stock levels, and view order details.

### Integration with Server/API:
- Communicate with the backend API endpoints using asynchronous requests to fetch product data, manage user authentication, and handle checkout processes.
- Implement secure authentication mechanisms such as OAuth or token-based authentication to authorize requests.

### Testing and Quality Assurance:
- Conduct unit tests for individual components using testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library.
- Perform integration tests to ensure proper interaction with backend API endpoints.
Conduct user acceptance testing to validate functionality and usability.

### Deployment and Maintenance:
- (Deploy the frontend application on a reliable hosting service such as AWS S3, Netlify, or Vercel.)
- (Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated deployment.)
- (Regularly monitor performance metrics and user feedback for improvements.)
